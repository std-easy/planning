## Less-Terrible std::visit

`std::visit`, with the need for user-defined `overloaded` operators to be remotely useful, is frankly horrible. 

## `enum class` stringification

A clean way to convert a enum class to the string representation of the values would be nice.
(I mostly want this to make python interfaces nicer. Having to hand roll switch-cases for every enum class I'm passing through an interface is annoying)
